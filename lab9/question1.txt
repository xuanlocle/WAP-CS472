//Console (mode module)
promise 1
nextTick 1
setImmediate 1
setTimeout 1
Hello

Explain: In module mode, the import fs from file return a promise -> it's come to promise microtasks, 
That's why 'promise 1' be printed first before print 'nextTick'.
Then, the IO phase was complete, move to next queue in event loop: check phase, that's why 'setImmediate' be printed. 
After check phase, it move to Timer phase and print the 'setTimeout'. 
Then the readFile invoke the IO phase, then print the 'input.txt' file's content.


//Console (mode commonjs)
nextTick 1
promise 1
setTimeout 1
setImmediate 1
Hello

Explain: In commonjs, the require function is used to import fs. So, the nextTick is printed first, then promise (microtasks). 
Then evenloop will move to timer phase and print setTimeout, then move to check phase to print 'setImmediate'. 
After read file, move to IO phase and print file's content.
